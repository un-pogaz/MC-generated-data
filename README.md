The Generated Data are all the internal files used by Minecraft. The files can be the textures, block models, NBT structure files, recipes, tags and many others more technical, like the files for the world generation.
In addition to the Minecraft files, the folder `lists` contains text and json files which allows to compare more easily some very technical changes.
